  <span class="problemtitle">Hohmann Transfer Orbit</span>
  <span class="toggle"><p> The Hohmann problem requires the controller to transfer the
satellite, initally in a circular orbit around earth, into a different
circular orbit. The simulator exposes environment sensor data, as
shown in the table below.  The Score sensor is the score calculated
(according to the formuale in sec- tion 7 of the specification
document) by the simulation binary. This score will be 0.0 initially,
and will only change when the task has been completed
successfully. The Fuel Remaining sensor represents a fuel guage,
measured in units of delta-v. At time step 0, the output of this sensor
represents a full fuel tank. This output will decrease as the thrust
actuator is employed by the controller program.  The position of the
controlled satellite relative to earth is decomposed into vector
components sx and sy . The radius of the target orbit is exposed by
the final sensor.  </p>

  <span class="problemtitle">Meet and Greet</span>
  <span class="toggle">In Meet and Greet, the contestant must move a satellite in a circular orbit about 
earth to meet with a second satellite, also in a circular orbit. The target satellite 
will maintain its orbit throughout the simulation. To successfully complete this 
challenge, the position of the controlled satellite must remain within 1km of the 
target for 900 consecutive seconds. 
The sensors associated with the Meet and Greet problem binary are shown 
in the table below. These are the same as the Hohmann problem, with the addition of 
two ports that give the vector to the target satellite from the controlled satellite.

  <span class="problemtitle">Eccentric Meet and Greet</span>
  <span class="toggle">This problem generalizes the Meet and Greet problem. The task remains
to move the satellite from one orbit to meet with a target
satellite. However, the orbits of both satellites can be arbitrary
ellipses. As with the Meet and Greet problem, the completion criteria
requires the controlled satellite to remain within 1km of the target
for 900 consecutive seconds. The sensor outputs for this problem are
the same as for the meet and greet problem, as shown in Meet and
Greet's table.  Again, the actuator inputs are those shown in table 6
of the specification document.</span>

  <span class="problemtitle">Operation Clear Skies</span>
  <span class="toggle">The challenge of the Operation Clear Skies problem is to control the
satellite so that it visits a collection of twelve target satellites,
each of which are in an elliptical orbit around earth. To successfully
visit a target satellite, the controlled satellite must pass within
1000 meters of the satellite. There is no requirement that the
satellite maintain a position within this radius for any longer than
one time step. Note that it may be possible to cross paths with the
target satellite without being within the maximum scoring radius at a
given time step. This will not count as successfully visiting the
satellite.  Because the Operation Clear Skies problem may require a
large number of orbit transfer maneuvers, there will be a special
refueling station in orbit.  Whenever the controlled satellite passes
within the visiting radius of the refueling station, the amount of
fuel required to fill the controlled satellite's tank will be
transferred from the station.  The sensor output port mappings for the
Operation Clear Skies problem are shown in table 9 in the
specification, reprinted below. The sensors for this problem include a
relative position vector between the controlled satellite and each
target satellite, as well as the fueling station. There are twelve
target satellites total, labelled target0 ... target11 , in addition
to the fueling station. In the sensor port mapping, each target
satellite has a sensor output which indicates whether that satellite
has been successfully visited. This output will be 1.0 if the
satellite has been visited, 0.0 otherwise.
