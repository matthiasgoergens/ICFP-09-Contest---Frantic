ICFP Contest 2009
Team: I C Frantic People

Team Members: Matthias GÃ¶rgens, Alexander Kiel, Anya Martius, Georg Martius, Patrick Schreibe

Languages: Haskell, Java, Perl

Tools we wrote:
VM in Haskell and in Java
Controller in Haskell
Controller in Java
Plotting in gnuplot
Analysis Tool of VM in Haskell

How to obtain solutions:  (ROOTDIR =  the root folder of this archive)
cd $ROOTDIR/HaskellVM/
make
./runC ../task/bin1.obf 1001 with +RTS -M1504m -RTS > 1001.output 
./createSub.sh 1001.0.input 1001.output 1001.osf  
# the same for 1002, 1003, 1004

./runC ../task/bin2.obf 2001 with +RTS -M1504m -RTS > 2001.output 
./createSub.sh 2001.0.input 2001.output 2001.osf  
# the same for 2003, 2004 (2002 did not work because of a memleak in the Controller)

# We did not manage task 3 and more
./runC ../task/bin3.obf 3001 with +RTS -M1504m -RTS > 3001.output 


General Remarks:
For some reason our hohmann transfer did not work when we tried it the first
 time such that we spend a lot of time implementing and thinking about complicated solutions

Conclusion:
Nice task, A bit too much "binary" for my tast and 
 too less ways of testing the implemenentation, e.g. the of submission file.

Thanks for the good organisation!
