ICFP Contest 2009
Team: I C Frantic People

Team Members: Matthias Goergens, Alexander Kiel, Anya Martius, Georg Martius, Patrick Schreibe

Languages: Haskell, Java, Perl

Tools we wrote:
VM in Haskell and in Java
Controller in Haskell
Controller in Java
Plotting in gnuplot
A simple controller in perl (only feedforward)
Analysis Tool of VM in Haskell

How to obtain solutions:  (ROOTDIR =  the root folder of this archive)
Task 1 in Java:
cd $ROOTDIR/run
./run_task1.sh

Task 1,2 in Haskell:
cd $ROOTDIR/HaskellVM/
make
cd $ROOTDIR/run
./run_tasks_haskell.sh

# for plotting e.g.
cd $ROOTDIR/run
./run_controller.sh ../task/bin3.obf 3001 with +RTS -M1504m -RTS | ./output2csv.sh > test.dat
gnuplot task3.dem
gnuplot distToSat.dem



General Remarks:
For some reason our hohmann transfer did not work when we tried it the first
 time such that we spend a lot of time implementing and thinking about complicated solutions

Conclusion:
Nice task, A bit too much "binary" for my tast and 
 too less ways of testing the implemenentation, e.g. the of submission file.

Thanks for the good organisation!
